Staff were lovely and service was quick too. We ordered the Green Goddess poached eggs and the potato farl. The green goddess was delicious - three thick slices of seedy toast, pea guacamole, 2 poached eggs, feta, spring onion, coriander and a drizzle of their house green goddess dressing. I highly recommend! Potato farl was served with sautéed onions, feta, fried egg, bacon and a drizzle of the green goddess dressing. We couldn't resist taking away a slice of the carrot cake and the chocolate fudge cake - divine!\",\n",

I was looking for a place for Afternoon Tea, and this place came up on a few websites I found when doing research. I opted for The Cake Cafe because it was much less pricey than other places. I ordered the Cake Bites with the Chillax Tea. My partner got the Detox Tea. The teas were delicious, and the cake bites were nice. I expected smaller cakes, but got a full slice of cake, a brownie, and a cookie. The cake was my favorite. The brownie was vegan, but full of flavor. The cookie was ehh... I did like the cute location of the cafe. It was hidden and away from main traffic. The staff was great, and the music was on point.',\n",

The food is so good, honestly you need to just try it. Homemade and decadent. Maybe stay away if you're on a diet.
